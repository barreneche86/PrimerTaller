### **Abstract**
The knowledge discovery in database (KDD) is alarmed with development of methods and techniques for
making use of data. One of the most important step of the KDD is the data mining. Data mining is the
process of pattern discovery and extraction where huge amount of data is involved. Both the data mining
and healthcare industry have emerged some of reliable early detection systems and other various
healthcare related systems from the clinical and diagnosis data. In regard to this emerge, we have
reviewed the various paper involved in this field in terms of method, algorithms and results. This review
paper has consolidated the papers reviewed inline to the disciplines, model, tasks and methods. Results
and evaluation methods are discussed for selected papers and a summary of the finding is presented to
conclude the paper.

**1 Introduction**

Across all the fields, data are being collected and accumulated at a vivid pace. There is an urgent need
for a new generation of computational theories and tools to assist humans in extracting useful information
(knowledge) from the rapidly growing volumes of digital data. At the core of the process is the
application of specific data mining methods for pattern discovery and extraction [1]. Among the data
mining techniques developed in recent years, the data mining methods are including generalization,
characterization, classification, clustering, association, evolution, pattern matching, data visualization and
meta-rule guided mining. [2]. As an element of data mining technique research, this paper surveys the 


*2.1. Disciplines Involved in Data Mining*

The data mining baseline is grounded by disciplines such as machine learning [4], artificial
intelligence [5], probability [6] and statistics [7]. The disciplines identified among the papers reviewed
are summarized in Table 1. Table 1 assets the disciplines mentioned for the papers reviewed.
